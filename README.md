# OCR for Handwritten Text

This repository provides an implementation of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for handwritten text. It includes a Jupyter notebook for training and evaluating the model, a detailed project report, and a demo video showcasing the results.

## Features
- OCR model trained to recognize handwritten text.
- Interactive Jupyter notebook for model training, testing, and inference.
- Project report in PDF format describing the methodology and results.
- Demo video showing the model's performance.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/VStr20/OCR-for-Handwritten-Text.git
cd OCR-for-Handwritten-Text
```

## Usage
# OCR Model
- Open the ocr-for-handwritten-text.ipynb notebook.
- Follow the instructions to preprocess the dataset, train the OCR model, and perform predictions on handwritten text.
#Demo Video
- Watch the demo video video2569104613.mp4 to see the model in action.
